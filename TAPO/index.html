      <div class="header">Morning Whispers</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 I.<br>I wrote your name where silence sleeps,<br>Between the lines my heartbeat keeps.<br>The moonlight whispers in quiet streams,<br>A shadow dancing in my dreams.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 II.<br>The morning breaks with golden hue,<br>My thoughts are drifting all to you.<br>Soft winds carry forgotten tales,<br>Across the hills and distant vales.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 III.<br>In every heart a secret lies,<br>Hidden deep from prying eyes.<br>A song that never sees the light,<br>Yet sings alone in silent night.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 IV.<br>Petals fall from unseen trees,<br>Carried gently by the breeze.<br>Time moves slow, yet fast it flies,<br>Beneath the endless open skies.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 V.<br>Every line I write for you,<br>Each word a spark, a flame anew.<br>Poetry flows like rivers wide,<br>Forever with you by my side.</div>

      <div class="header">Quiet Fire</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 I.<br>Love is not loud, it softly stays,<br>A quiet fire in hidden ways.<br>Moments linger, hearts entwine,<br>Shadows fade but souls align.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 II.<br>Through storms and sun, through night and day,<br>Words unspoken find their way.<br>Silent gestures, gentle touch,<br>Mean more than phrases said as much.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 III.<br>A candle flickers in the gloom,<br>Casting light across the room.<br>Every glance, a story told,<br>Every breath, a hand to hold.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 IV.<br>Footsteps echo on empty streets,<br>Whispering tales our hearts repeat.<br>Memories like golden thread,<br>Sew together words unsaid.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 V.<br>Life may twist and seasons bend,<br>Yet poetry will never end.<br>In ink and heart, our spirits meet,<br>In quiet corners, soft and sweet.</div>

      <div class="header">Whispers of the Hidden Heart</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 I.<br>The moon drapes silver over restless seas,<br>A mirror to the shadowed pulse of me.<br>In quiet, love plants its secret trees,<br>Roots tangled where none else can see.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 II.<br>Your voice, a river threading through the night,<br>Carries the weight of suns yet unseen.<br>Even stars bow to the gentle might<br>Of hearts that wander where time has been.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 III.<br>Petals fall where silence dares to tread,<br>Each a promise buried in the dust.<br>The wise have said, “Love speaks before it’s said,”<br>And waits in shadows, patient, true, and just.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 IV.<br>I hold your absence as one holds the flame,<br>A flicker that whispers, though unseen.<br>Even in voids, the echo knows your name,<br>A song of soft might between the between.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 V.<br>If love is wind, I am but paper bare,<br>Yet you, the ink that stains and does not flee.<br>All journeys start where hearts dare to dare,<br>And in your eyes, eternity bends to me.</div>

      <div class="page-number">IV</div>
      <div class="header">Whispers of the Butterfly</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 I.<br>A butterfly trembles in the garden’s sigh,<br>Wings painted with the dusk of a wondering sky.<br>Even the sun must pause to see her glow,<br>For beauty blooms quietly where hearts dare to grow.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 II.<br>The girl’s eyes, rivers that cradle the light,<br>Reflect the lost colors hidden from sight.<br>Love, they say, is a mirror in flight,<br>Showing the soul what the heart holds tight.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 III.<br>Between the wind and the whispering trees,<br>The butterfly dances with trembling ease.<br>To return or to rise—each choice a flame,<br>And all paths call softly her secret name.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 IV.<br>In the blink of an eye, the world bends near,<br>A hand extended, a promise sincere.<br>True love, like wings, must let the other soar,<br>Yet anchor the heart forevermore.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 V.<br>She lifts into gold, where horizons unfold,<br>A tale of courage the dawn dares to hold.<br>Love, a gentle wind, carries her high,<br>And even in parting, hearts never say goodbye.</div>

      <div class="header">The Wanderer’s Heart</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 I.<br>Beneath the sky, I walk through endless streets,<br>A seeker chasing echoes of a face.<br>The wind whispers riddles in my heartbeat,<br>Love hides in shadows time cannot erase.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 II.<br>Each smile I pass is a lantern in the dark,<br>Yet none ignite the fire I chase.<br>They say the heart must wander to leave a mark,<br>So I tread alone in this quiet space.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 III.<br>Petals of hope scatter where my feet fall,<br>Fragile as dreams that tremble in the night.<br>The proverb says, “He who dares may call,”<br>Yet I whisper to stars, yearning for light.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 IV.<br>I watch the river bend, seeking its shore,<br>It knows the path, though twists remain.<br>So I, too, search for the one I adore,<br>Through storms, through tears, through gentle pain.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 V.<br>Perhaps love sleeps where eyes have yet to meet,<br>A secret garden behind the veil of fear.<br>I keep walking, guided by the heartbeat,<br>Hoping one day a kindred soul draws near.</div>

      <div class="header">The Heart’s Crossroads</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 I.<br>She walks in light that bends the room,<br>A friend in name, a fire in disguise.<br>He feels the pull, a silent, rising gloom,<br>Truth hidden where the shadow lies.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 II.<br>The vow he swore trembles like a leaf,<br>In hands that tremble, loyalty divides.<br>“Desire blinds,” whispers the wind in grief,<br>And yet the heart leans where temptation hides.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 III.<br>Her laughter drips like honey on his fear,<br>Sweet, forbidden, impossible to claim.<br>A proverb echoes sharp, yet unclear:<br>“Even rivers split for rocks, yet change their name.”</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 IV.<br>He stands between two worlds, unsure, undone,<br>One safe harbor, one storm-lit flame.<br>Every glance she casts feels like the sun,<br>Burning lines of right and wrong the same.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 V.<br>The heart debates, the mind can’t sway,<br>Choices whisper like ghosts in the night.<br>Love’s crooked path leads where shadows play,<br>And only courage—or folly—reveals the light.</div>

      <div class="header">The Girl by the Coast</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 I.<br>I saw her where the tide kissed golden sand,<br>A vision fragile, like a drifting leaf.<br>Her eyes were oceans, deep and unplanned,<br>Reflecting every secret, every grief.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 II.<br>A face like dawn, slim, soft, and fair,<br>Petite as a leaf upon the morning breeze.<br>Her lips held whispers hidden in the air,<br>A fleeting moment, designed to tease.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 III.<br>Her laughter fluttered, a leaf in flight,<br>Dancing free, yet slipping through my hand.<br>I reached, but she vanished into light,<br>Lost in the crowd, like driftwood on sand.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 IV.<br>My heart, a tree, shook with silent pain,<br>Each beat a leaf torn by winds of desire.<br>No trace remained, no sun, no rain,<br>Only memory’s spark, and longing’s fire.</div>
      <div class="band">🌿 V.<br>She disappeared, a leaf carried by fate’s stream,<br>Yet the wind holds her scent in every sigh.<br>Love struck sudden, bright as a dream,<br>And leaves my soul chasing the sky.</div>
